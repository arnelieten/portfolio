                <h1>LEXLOOP</h1>
                <h2>LexLoop is a sophisticated language learning web application designed to help users expand their French vocabulary through personalized flashcards. The app processes PDF documents uploaded by users, extracting relevant French words and automatically translating them to English. What sets LexLoop apart is its intelligent natural language processing capabilities. LexLoop identifies parts of speech, adds appropriate articles to nouns, and converts verbs to their infinitive forms to create contextually accurate flashcards.</h2>
                <h2>The application features a secure user authentication system with password reset functionality, personalized dashboards displaying learning statistics, and an interactive flashcard interface for effective memorization. Built with Flask, the backend leverages powerful libraries including PyMuPDF for document processing, spaCy for linguistic analysis, and Hugging Face's transformer models for accurate French-to-English translation. The database architecture efficiently manages user accounts, vocabulary collections, and learning progress tracking, making LexLoop a complete solution.</h2>
